# FPGA Passive Autofocus

A FPGA-implementation of passive autofocus. This project is made by [@fyquah95](https://github.com/fyquah95) and [@tomhartley](https://github.com/tomhartley).

## Hardware

We utilized the following hardware in our project

- [Altera DE0 FPGA Board](http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=364)
- [Terasic D5M Camera](http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?No=281)
- [Parallax Continuous Rotation Servo](https://www.parallax.com/product/900-00008)
- Laser-cut gears and rack (CAD Draings available in this repository)

The FPGA onboard the DE0 is a Altera Cyclone III EPC16F484C

## Software
